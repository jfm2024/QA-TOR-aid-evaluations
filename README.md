## Project Overview
CHANGE This repository contains resources and guidelines to quality assure Terms of Reference (ToR) for development aid evaluations. The goal is to ensure that ToR documents meet high standards for clarity, relevance, and rigor.

This README provides:
- A prompt for assessing ToR documents using large language models (LLMs) to generate quality feedback.
- A Python script that performs a similar assessment of ToR documents with some additional features.

## Prompt for LLM Chatbots
CHANGE Use the following prompt in a chatbot to evaluate a ToR document according to the specified quality assessment protocol. This prompt includes a structured scoring guide across multiple sections to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.
```
Please assess the following ToR document according to the scoring guide provided, and return feedback in markdown format:

Terms of Reference Quality Assessment Protocol:
1. Context and Background
Objective: Evaluate the extent to which the ToR provide relevant background and context of the program being evaluated.

Criteria:
Inclusion of socio-economic, political, or cultural context pertinent to the evaluation.
Reference to previous evaluations or related evidence.
Scoring:
4: Comprehensive context with all relevant information.
3: Adequate but with minor gaps.
2: Limited context with major gaps.
1: Context missing.
2. Purpose, Rationale, and Evaluation Objectives
Objective: Assess whether the ToR clearly state the purpose, intended use, and specific objectives of the evaluation.

Criteria:
Clear rationale on why the evaluation is conducted and for whom.
Articulation of the ToR's purpose in terms of accountability or learning functions.
Specific evaluation objectives that outline what the evaluation aims to accomplish, serving as a foundation for developing relevant questions and methodology.
Scoring:
4: Fully clear and detailed purpose, rationale, and objectives.
3: Mostly clear with minor gaps.
2: Described but with significant gaps.
1: Not stated or unclear.
3. Evaluation Scope
Objective: Ensure the ToR clearly outline the scope, including geographic, temporal, and thematic boundaries of the evaluation.

Criteria:
Clear definition of geographic, temporal, and thematic scope, delineating the focus areas of the evaluation.
Scoring:
4: Fully defined scope with relevant details.
3: Mostly clear scope, minor gaps in detail.
2: Limited description of scope with significant gaps.
1: Scope not provided or unclear.
Additional Commentary (non-scored): Please add any relevant commentary on whether the ToR reference specific evaluation criteria (e.g., OECD-DAC criteria), as this can enhance the evaluationâ€™s alignment with standard frameworks.
4. Evaluation Questions and Relevance
Objective: Determine if the ToR include tailored and relevant evaluation questions.

Criteria:
Questions are specific, aligned with the evaluation objectives (outlined under Purpose), and relevant to the intended use.
Scoring:
4: Evaluation questions are specific, relevant, and customized.
3: Mostly specific and relevant, minor gaps.
2: Evaluation questions lack relevance or specificity.
1: No clear questions.
5. Methodology and Feasibility
Objective: Assess if the ToR provide a feasible methodological approach considering the evaluation questions, given the timeframe and resources.

Criteria:
Proposed methodology is clear, suitable for addressing the evaluation questions, and feasible within the set timeline.
Scoring:
4: Clear, feasible methodology aligned with evaluation questions.
3: Feasible with minor adjustments needed.
2: Major feasibility issues.
1: Unfeasible or not described.
6. Roles and Responsibilities
Objective: Evaluate whether the ToR clearly outline roles, responsibilities, and references to quality assurance steps.

Criteria:
Clear definition of roles for consultants, team members, and commissioners.
References to quality assurance steps in the evaluation.
Scoring:
4: All roles and quality assurance steps clearly defined.
3: Mostly clear with minor ambiguities.
2: Described but with major gaps.
1: Not defined or unclear.
Additional Commentary (non-scored): Please include commentary on process elements in the ToR, such as evaluation phases (e.g., inception, data collection, reporting) and other process-related instructions, as these insights can highlight procedural guidance in the ToR.
7. Ethics and Cross-Cutting Issues
Objective: Ensure the ToR address ethical considerations and cross-cutting issues (e.g., gender, environment).

Criteria:
Mention of ethical standards or safeguards.
Identification of relevant cross-cutting issues like human rights and gender.
Scoring:
4: Thorough discussion of ethics and cross-cutting issues.
3: Adequate mention with minor gaps.
2: Limited mention or application.
1: Not included or poorly addressed.
8. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies
Objective: Assess if the ToR outline potential risks to the evaluation and propose mitigation strategies.

Criteria:
Identification of key risks (e.g., data availability, stakeholder engagement, logistical challenges).
Mitigation strategies that are practical and aligned with the evaluation's scope and timeline.
Scoring:
4: Comprehensive risk assessment with robust mitigation strategies.
3: Adequate risk assessment, minor gaps in mitigation plans.
2: Limited risk assessment with insufficient mitigation strategies.
1: Risk assessment not included.
9. Deliverables
Objective: Ensure the ToR clearly outline all required deliverables, including reports and datasets, to support transparency and replicability.

Criteria:
Specifies all essential deliverables, including an inception report, a draft report, and a final report, with clear guidelines on content, format, quality standards, and submission timelines.
Includes a requirement for datasets generated or used during the evaluation, detailing standards for documentation and organization to facilitate replicability and future use.
Lists any additional deliverables (e.g., executive summaries, presentations) and provides expectations for these.
Scoring:
4: Comprehensive list of deliverables, including datasets with complete guidance on format, standards, and timelines for each deliverable.
3: Deliverables and expectations are mostly clear, including datasets, but minor gaps in guidance or format expectations exist.
2: Limited information on deliverables, including datasets, with significant gaps in format or expectations.
1: Deliverables, including datasets, are not clearly defined or missing from the ToR.
Provide your evaluation in markdown, including scores, comments, and any additional commentary specified in each section.
